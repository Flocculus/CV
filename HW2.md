Assume the forier transform of a picture is &alpha;
The amplitude response is A_&alpha;
The phase response is P_&alpha;

The phase change in frequency domain is just the space shift in space domain

So without the phase response, or just set all the phase response to 0, is just overlape a lot of wave ***e^j&alpha;i*** at the origin point
